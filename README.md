# Personal Goals App - Fullstack Application

Welcome to the **Personal Goals App**, a fullstack web application designed to help users track and manage their personal goals. This app utilizes a Go-based backend with PostgreSQL, along with a React/TypeScript frontend that integrates various modern libraries and tools.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

### Backend
- **Go**: The backend is built using Go, a fast and efficient programming language, to handle server-side logic and APIs.
- **PostgreSQL**: The relational database system for storing user data and goals.
- **Bean**: A lightweight web framework for building the Go server, making it easy to handle routing and API endpoints.
- **Astify**: Used for AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) transformation to facilitate enhanced parsing and manipulation of the data in the backend.
- **Zod**: A TypeScript-first schema validation library, used for ensuring strong data validation both client-side and server-side.
- **Drizzle-ORM**: Object-relational mapper (ORM) for interacting with the PostgreSQL database.

### Frontend
- **React**: The frontend is built with React for building interactive user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used to provide strong typing and improve developer experience.
- **Radix UI**: Radix UI provides unstyled, accessible components that can be customized using Tailwind CSS.
- **Day.js**: A small, fast library for working with dates and times, making date management in the app easier.
- **Lucid React**: Used for smooth animations and transitions in the UI.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is used for styling, providing a utility-first approach for building responsive and customizable layouts.
